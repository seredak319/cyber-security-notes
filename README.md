# Security Project - Enhancing Web Application Defense Mechanisms

## Overview
This project focuses on fortifying web application security by implementing a robust defense system against common vulnerabilities and attacks. It encompasses a variety of measures aimed at safeguarding user data, mitigating risks, and ensuring secure access to resources.

## Defenses Implemented
- **Input Data Validation (with negative bias):** Ensures that input data undergoes thorough validation, mitigating potential injection attacks.
- **Delay and Attempt Limits:** Implements delays and limits on login attempts to thwart remote guessing and brute-force attacks.
- **Limited Error Disclosure:** Minimizes error disclosure, providing limited information to potential attackers.
- **Secure Password Storage:** Utilizes cryptographic hash functions, salts, and iterative hashing for secure password storage.
- **Password Strength Control:** Enforces password strength policies to educate users about potential vulnerabilities.
- **Resource Permission Management:** Implements resource access controls to regulate user privileges effectively.

## Containerization with Docker
The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability. 
## Database and Web Server
- **Database:** The application utilizes an SQL database.
- **Web Server:** Production-grade web server Nginx is employed for hosting.

## Secure Communication
All communications with the application are encrypted to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

## Additional Security Measures
- **Negative Input Validation:** All user input undergoes strict validation to prevent malicious exploitation.
- **User Access Verification:** Verifies user access to resources to prevent unauthorized entry.
- **Login Attempt Monitoring:** Monitors and tracks unsuccessful login attempts for security analysis.
- **Password Quality Checks:** Evaluates password strength metrics (e.g., entropy) to enforce strong authentication.
- **Login Delay:** Implements login delays to thwart automated login attacks.
- **Thorough Understanding of Framework and Modules:** Ensures a comprehensive understanding of the application framework and modules for effective security implementation.

## Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)
Integrates Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication for an added layer of security, enhancing user authentication processes.

## SSL with Nginx
Utilizes SSL certificates with Nginx for secure HTTPS connections, ensuring data transmission integrity and confidentiality.
